title: HTTP Gateways
description: |
  IPFS Gateway acts as a bridge between traditional HTTP clients and IPFS. Through the gateway, users can download files,
  directories and other IPLD data stored in IPFS as if they were stored in a traditional web server.

  <h3>HTTP</h3>
  <p>
    Low-level gateways that expose IPFS resources over HTTP protocol.

      The most versatile form of IPFS Gateway is a Path Gateway. It exposes namespaces like <code>/ipfs/</code> and
      <code>/ipns/</code> under an HTTP server root and provides basic primitives for integrating IPFS resources
      within the existing HTTP stack.

    <dt><a href="/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/">Trustless Gateways</a></dt>
    <dd>
      Trustless Gateways are a minimal <em>subset</em> of <a href="/http-gateways/path-gateway/">Path Gateways</a>
      that allow light IPFS clients to retrieve data behind a CID and verify its integrity without delegating any
      trust to the gateway itself.

      DNSLink Gateways are an extension of <a href="/http-gateways/path-gateway/">Path Gateways</a> that enable hosting a
      specific content path under a specific DNS name.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="/http-gateways/subdomain-gateway/">Subdomain Gateways</a></dt>
    <dd>
      Subdomain Gateways are an extension of <a href="/http-gateways/path-gateway/">Path Gateways</a> that
      enable website hosting isolated per CID/name, while remaining compatible with web browsers relative pathing and
      the security model of the web.

    <dd>
      The Redirects File specification is an extension of the Subdomain Gateway and DNSLink Gateway specifications that
      enables URL redirects or rewrites by adding redirect rules to a0 file stored underneath the root CID of a web
      site.
