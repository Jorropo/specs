## Summary

This IPIP specifies `/routing/v1/peers/{peer-id}` HTTP API to offload peer routing onto another server.

## Motivation

The motivation of this IPIP extends the one of :cite[ipip-0337] and :cite[ipip-0379],
which introduced delegated content routing and delegated naming, respectively. Now,
we expand upon those basis to introduce peer routing, reducing the barrier for interaction
across different systems.

## Detailed design

Add `/routing/v1/peers/{peer-id}` to the existing :cite[http-routing-v1] specification,
as well as the new Peer schema.

## Design rationale

In line with the remaining Routing V1 API, this IPIP introduces a new HTTP GET
endpoint that is used to retrieve peer records for a certain peer.

### User benefit

The user benefit brought by this PR is similar to the one in :cite[ipip-0379],
but instead of offloading the naming process, we offload the peer discovery and
routing.

### Compatibility

See the "Compatibility" section of :cite[ipip-0337].
